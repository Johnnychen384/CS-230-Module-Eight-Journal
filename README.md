## The Gaming Room - Software Design Document
This repository contains the completed software design document for The Gaming Room client project. The document was structured using predefined sections provided for the course. I conducted research to complete each part of the design, focusing on scalability, distributed architecture, and user needs. Below are answers to the required reflection questions.

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand their mobile game, Draw It or Lose It, to additional platforms like Windows, MacOS, Linux, and other mobile devices. They needed a scalable, distributed system that could deliver a consistent and reliable experience across all platforms. I was tasked with completing a predefined software design document by researching each section and recommending appropriate architectures, technologies, and security strategies.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I clearly organized the content and backed each section with strong research. I aligned the technology choices such as using cloud hosting, distributed architecture, and memory caching with the client’s business goals. I also made sure the writing was clear enough for both technical and non technical readers.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The structured design document made it much easier to think through the entire system before beginning development. It helped identify key considerations like handling scalability, cross platform compatibility, and user session management early in the process, which made writing the code more efficient and better planned.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise the work, I would add more visuals such as architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and database relationship diagrams. Although the written sections were thorough, having more visuals would make it even easier for stakeholders to quickly understand the design.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure the design supported cross-platform functionality, scalability for a growing user base, and secure user interactions. User needs were at the center of the design because a software solution can only succeed if it meets expectations for reliability, accessibility, and performance across all devices.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started by reviewing the client’s goals, researched best practices for scalable distributed systems, and mapped out a high level system architecture before selecting specific technologies. In the future, I would continue using structured templates, focus more on early diagramming, and keep user centric thinking at the forefront to ensure the design aligns with real-world needs.
